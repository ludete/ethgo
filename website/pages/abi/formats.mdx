# Formats

You can read from several formats

The ABI is xxx and xxx. It includes two things and specially to call an Ethereum smart contract.

## ABI files

The abi is in JSON format and looks like this 

```
[
	{
		"method": ...
	}
]
```

To read the ABI file use with `input` as string:

```go

import "github.com/umbracle/go-web3/abi"

abi, err := abi.NewABI(input)
```

### Methods

once you have it you can call the instances of the methods like:

with this you use an array to include the things:

```
method := abi.GetMethod("getBalance")
method.Encode([]interface{addr})
```

this results in the data used to send to the call. This things includes two things, first the 4 bytes which represent the call and then the ABI encoding of the input parameters.

### Events

```
event := abi.GetEvent("Event1")
```
