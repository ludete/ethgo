# Ethereum

Ethereum is for things related to the endpoints. There are two types of endpoints, the ones that do not have.. and the ones that.. You have to consider that when talking with nodes on infra services, endpoints that assume accounts will not be available. Thus, we have not given much support to those either in this library.
