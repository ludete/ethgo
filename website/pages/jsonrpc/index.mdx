# JsonRPC

Ethereum uses JsonRPC to send requests, here is a list of the endpoints supported.
As of now, there are three rules for the endpoints supported here:
- Major endpoints supported in Geth.
- Supported by Infra providers.

## Overview

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/umbracle/go-web3/jsonrpc"
)

func main() {
	client, err := jsonrpc.NewClient("https://mainnet.infura.io")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

Be careful because by default the Go linter imports the native library (`encoding/jsonrpc`) when completing code.

The library supports `websocket`, `http` and `ipc`, you only need to set the specific endpoint for each one.

For websockets:

```go
client, err := jsonrpc.NewClient("wss://mainnet.infura.io")
```

or Ipc:

```go
client, err := jsonrpc.NewClient("ipc://path/geth.ipc")
```

It also supports custom headers:

```go
headers := map[string]string{
    "": "", // token
}
client, err := jsonrpc.NewClient("...", jsonrpc.WithHeaders(headers))
```

useful to set tokens to access the endpoints. By default, JsonRPC already sends the "application/json" to each of the endpoints.

## Endpoints

Once create the client instance, each of the endpoints is separated in different namespaces:

```
eth := client.Eth()
```

so that we can separate the different endpoints like in the original spec.

The current available are:

- [Eth](./jsonrpc/eth): Ethereum endpoints.
- [Debug](./jsonrpc/debug): Debug the client.
- [Net](./jsonrpc/net): For some data about the client.

## Subscribe

This is only enabled for `websocket` and `ipc` transport that support streaming. There are some endpoints.
